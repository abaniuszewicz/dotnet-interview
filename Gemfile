# Specify <= 1.71.1 version of sass-embedded, otherwise Github Actions errors.
# Try to remove later on and check if Actions succeed.
# Your bundle is locked to sass-embedded (1.71.1-x64-mingw-ucrt) from rubygems
# repository https://rubygems.org/ or installed locally, but that version can no
# longer be found in that source. That means the author of sass-embedded
# (1.71.1-x64-mingw-ucrt) has removed it. You'll need to update your bundle to a
# version other than sass-embedded (1.71.1-x64-mingw-ucrt) that hasn't been
# removed in order to install.
